Welcome to the Twitter Clone created by Apoorv Verma and Chand Babu!

This project aims to replicate the basic functionality of the popular social media platform, Twitter. Users can create an account, follow other users, post tweets, and interact with other users' tweets by liking and commenting on them.

To get started, clone or download the project from the GitHub repository. You will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.

Once you have the project on your machine, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run npm install to install all the required dependencies.

To start the application, run npm start in your terminal. The application will be hosted on http://localhost:3000/.

You can create a new account by clicking on the "Sign up" button on the homepage. Once you have created an account, you can log in and start using the platform.

From the dashboard, you can create new tweets, follow other users, and view your timeline to see the tweets posted by users you follow. You can also view your profile to see your own tweets, followers, and following.

Overall, this Twitter clone provides a basic platform for users to engage with each other in a similar way to the original Twitter. Please note that this project is not intended for production use and is only meant for learning purposes.

If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to reach out to the project creators,
